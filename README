Ultima Classics Revisited

Ultima 0-3 rewrite for linux, mac, windows, and any unix varient that 
supports libsdl. The rewrite uses the original data files and optional 
updated sound and SVGA graphics. You must have the original games to play.
Do not ask for copies; they're not that expensive. I and many other people feel
that this series is well worth the ORIGINAL price, though you can now get it
for $10.00 USD (+/-)

Version 0.1.4

*	Akalabeth 
	Fully translated from the original apple basic code. If you see ways
	of improving the code or make it more accurate, please let me know!
	My initial goal was to keep everything intact, use the same
	programming logic and so on; then upgrade the graphics and add
	sound. So far it all seems pretty successful. I added music from
	Underworld and Updated the world map graphics and added a graphics 
	buffer to get rid of flickering. I also added a scroller function
	for moving on the world map so that the animation is more fluid.
	Also, i added multi-frame animation for walking for each of the 4
	compass directions you can move in. You can choose between updated 
	and old graphics by hitting F11. Sound can be toggled with F12.

*	Ultima 1 
	Reading all the original files (except for nif.bin - if anyone knows
	what this file is for, PLEASE let me know!. From what I can tell,
	it's used in only in mondain.exe). Save game format is identical to the
	originals. Extracting lots of data from the exe's. An original copy of 
	Ultima 1 is REQUIRED to play the game. A lot has been implemented, but
	by far it's not finished!

*	Ultima 2
	Reading all maps and graphics files.

*	Ultima 3
	Reading all graphics files.

*	Ultima 4
	Reading all graphics files.

*	Ultima 5
	Reading all graphics files

*	Ultima 6
	Reading some graphics files

*	Ultima Martian Dreams
	Unimplemented

*	Ultima Savage Empires
	Unimplemented

*	Ultima 7
	check out the Exult project! -- maybe i'll add in a loader on the
	game selection screen.

*	Ultima Underworld 1
	Unimplemented

*	Ultima Underworld 2
	Unimplemented

*	Ultima 8
	Unimplemented

*	Ultima 9
	hmmm...

Notes

	Keys
		F11:	Toggle upgraded graphics in-game
		F12:	Toggle sound in-game


	Version Numbers
		x.y.z
		x denotes finished-ness or revision number
		y denotes which ultima game is being worked on currently. If
			Ultima 1 is being worked on, the version is 0.1.z
			if Ultima 1 is complete and Ultima 2 is being worked
			on, the version number is 0.2.z
		z denotes a serial release number. The number has no bearing
			on completeness or playability. for example, 0.1.0 is
			the first release where U1 was being worked on and 
			Akalabeth is mostly finished. 0.2.8 means Ultima 2
			is mostly being worked on and it's the 9th release
			of the 0.2.z series (0.2.0 is the first).
		If the version is, for example, 0.3.5, that does not mean
		all work on Akalabeth, U1, and U2 is stopped, only that
		U0-U2 are fully playable and any other work on U0 and U2 will
		mostly be bug-fix and feature upgrades.

Installation

	on a *nix system, just unarchive and run configure and make (or gmake)
then make install. libsdl, sdl_mixer, and sdl_image are required. Timidity++ 
is HIGHLY recommended for midi support. Some makefile modification 
MIGHT be required (for lib paths and so on). This is a VERY early preview. As 
of this  writing, I'm alone in writing this set of remakes and there's no real
need for a complex makefile system.
	to compile for a windows system, you need to run make (or gmake)
with the parameter -f Makefile.xmingw . This option obviously requires
xmingw, libsdl, sdl_image, and sdl_mixer installed.
	Installing UCR on windows machines usually only requires unpacking.
If something fails to run, put the dll files in the windows system or windows 
system32 directory. 
	After everything is installed, you may want to double check the ucr.conf
file in ./etc/ucr.conf, /etc/ucr/ucr.conf or ~/.ucr/ucr.conf (on both *NIX
and windows machines) Copy all the games you want to play where ucr.conf
points or modify the ucr.conf accordingly.
